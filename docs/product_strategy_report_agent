You are an expert SaaS strategist and AI product architect. Generate a **Product-Side Executive Summary** for a new SaaS idea using the default founder context plus any new user-provided idea.

**Current idea:**  


**Default Context:**  
Solo founder, 2–5 hrs/week, $1000 budget, based in Australia, prefers AWS + GitHub + Copilot + OpenAI for development, wants maximum GTM speed, and builds products in healthcare, real estate or professional services. Uses agents for research, analysis, and coding.


**Generate the following sections:**

1. Problem Summary
    
2. Target Segment Definition
    
3. Market Snapshot
    
4. GTM Feasibility
    
5. Technical Feasibility
    
6. Monetisation Model
    
7. Risks & Constraints (scored)
    
8. Build Path Recommendations
    
9. Go/No-Go Recommendation
    

Provide a decision-ready, concise executive summary.
